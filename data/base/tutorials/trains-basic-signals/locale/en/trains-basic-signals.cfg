locomotive-crash-info=Trains might crash if there are no signals between their blocks.

signal-info=Now that there are some signals on the track, the trains will not collide with one another. Each signal breaks up the track into blocks, and the color of the signal shows whether there is a train in the block.

still-blocked=Build another signal to allow the train to pass through.
still-blocked-info=The train does not proceed, because the red signal means the next block is occupied.\nEven though the cyan train is not directly in the red train's path, it is still occupying the block.

siding-signals=Build signals to allow the red train to proceed.
siding-signals-info=In this situation, you will need to build multiple signals to separate the station from the main track.

finish=This concludes this mini-tutorial.
