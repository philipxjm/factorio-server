deadlock-1=In this situation the second cyan train blocks the intersection, so the red train cannot continue to the station.
deadlock-2=The red train can only continue once the cyan train moves along.

chain-signal-1=Building chain signals before the intersection will prevent the trains from entering the block unless their exit is also clear.
chain-signal-2=The cyan train on the left will wait at the chain signal until its path is open, and will not block the red train.

fix-intersection=Build signals to allow the red trains to get to their stations.

start-trains=Run the trains
reset-trains=Reset trains
reset-all=Reset all

finish=This concludes this mini-tutorial.
finish-button=Finish

chain-green=The chain signal is the second type of rail signal. They read the next signals in the path and change their state accordingly.\n\nA green chain signal means that all the next blocks are open, and have a green signal or green chain signal.
chain-blue-go=A blue chain signal means that only some of the paths are open. In this situation, one of the signals is red, which is why the chain signal is blue.\n\nThe train can pass a blue signal if the path to its destination is open.
chain-blue-stop=In this situation the chain signal is blue, because not all paths are open. The train will wait at the blue signal, because its path is not open.
chain-red=A red chain signal means that all the next blocks are occupied, and there are no open paths from this chain signal. A train will wait at a red chain signal.
