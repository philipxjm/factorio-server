Version: 0.16.9
Date: 29. 12. 2017
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that player didn't request from buffer chests.
    - Fixed that some maps with modded selection-tool items failed to load.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.8
Date: 29. 12. 2017
  Features:
    - Storage chests can be filtered.
  Minor Features:
    - Requester chests can now request stuff from buffer chests as was originally intended. Buffer chests are provided items
      only if all requester chests are satisfied for that specific item.
    - Requester chests have a checkbox that specifies whether it should or shouldn't request things from buffer chests. It is off by default.
  Optimisations:
    - Optimized selecting robot tasks for requester chests.
  Balancing:
    - Changed fluid wagon capacity from 75k to 25k (Same as storage tank).
    - Lowered fluid wagon weight from 3000 to 1000 (same as cargo wagon).
    - Changed fluid wagon recipe so it requires just 1 storage tank instead of 3.
    - Lowered barrel fluid capacity from 250 to 50. (So cargo wagon with barrels holds 20k and logistic robots are not too strong alternative to carrying fluids.)
    - Decreased barreling crafting time from 1 second to 0.2 seconds.

  Changes:
    - Added headless server option --server-id to allow specifying custom path to the server ID file.
    - Increased the minimum custom UI scale from 50% to 80% to avoid some scaling issues.
    - The zoom level at which the map switches from 'map view' to 'world view' was increased.
    - The first level of infinite researches is not needed for the tech maniac achievement anymore.
    - The game will default to low sprite quality on computers with less than 2.5GB RAM. (https://forums.factorio.com/47525)

    - Removed the zoom-to-world-outside-coverage debug option because it was causing issues. (https://forums.factorio.com/47442)
    - Added "create specialized sprite atlases" option to graphics settings. If checked, tile and shadow sprites won't be put into separated sprite atlases
      instead of the main one. This should give graphics driver more room to fit required sprites to graphics memory.

    - Inventory filter slots can be copy-pasted from empty slots onto empty slots using the stack transfer/split controls (shift + left click, shift + right click by default).
  Balancing:
    - The productivity module pollution addition was lowered (30%->5%, 40%->7.5%, 50%->10%), as the pollution generated by the machine is already increased
      by the additional energy production and time, it doesn't need to be so high as the modules are quite expensive already.
    - Repair packs have double durability (100->200) and stack size (50->100).
    - Changed stack size of raw wood (50->100) so it doesn't fill the inventory so quickly.
    - Roboport have decreased transmission power consumption (200kw->50kw) while the robots (and their recharging) has increased power consumption (200kW per recharge slot to 1Mw per slot)
      Basically, covering area by roboports is cheaper, but using robots for transport is more expensive. To keep the personal roboport usefulness, energies used in personal roboport have been
      all multiplied by 10.
    - Inserters are able to squeeze things "slightly" better to belts. more resources.
    - Increased size of several green science and few blue science technologies.
    - Increased inventory size of cargo wagon. (30->40)
    - Oil yield drains to 10% two times slower.

    - Increased the ghost time to live when something is destroyed from 5 + 5 minutes to 30 + 30 minutes.
    - Halved the mining time of rails, rail signals and walls.
    - Changed the way evolution factor approaches the maximum (1).
      The addition of evolution factor was changed from addition * (1 - evolution) to addition * (1 - evolution)^2
      This means that the progress gets more slower towards the high values.
    - Balanced train acceleration and top speed, additional wagons no longer slow trains so strongly.
    - Changed the amount of items requested when copy-pasting assembling machines to requester chests for several recipes.
    - Express underground belts require lubricant to match the express belts and express splitters.
    - Increased battery equipment power storage, input, and output by a factor of 20.
  Changes:
    - Reduced number of connections drawn between roboports in blueprint and roboports on map.
    - More virtual signals for combinators.
    - Virtual signals can be used in blueprint icons.
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.10.0 version (You can use 0.10.12 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - Removed multiplayer peer-to-peer mode.
    - Ghosts created by player no longer expire and can be placed before researching any technologies.
    - Ghosts are brighter and easier to see.
    - Alert of destroyed entity exists 2 times longer.
    - Quickbar filters are set and unset using the same key.
    - Loading a scenario without control.lua will automatically load the freeplay game mode scripts.
      This means new maps created in the map editor will get the freeplay game mode.
    - Loading a scenario in the map editor will preserve it's scripts.
      This means custom freeplay/sandbox maps can be created in-game.
    - Constant combinator can be rotated.

Version: 0.12.11
Date: 16. 10. 2015
  Features:
    - Added --no-auto-pause: When running as a server, --no-auto-pause will prevent stopping the game when no players are connected.
  Optimisations:
    - Optimised the particle performance. Helps during heavy fights.
  Changes:
    - Showing the log file location when the game crashes, so it is easier to find when reporting the bug.
    - The "graphics.force-opengl" option default value is true when AMD graphics card is present.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that multiple electric networks connected to a solar panel could be exploited to generate more energy. (https://forums.factorio.com/16778)

  Scripting:
    - Changed LuaSurface::set_multi_command signature. Now the function takes a table with following keys:
      command(required), unit_count(required), force(optional), unit_search_distance(optional)
      This solves issue with not finding any enemies to attack: https://forums.factorio.com/16541
    - Removed game.on_save function. There should be no need for it and it was causing too many problems.
    - Lua on_load function is not called when saving the game anymore. It is called only on actual load now.
    - Lua API calls on_load, on_init, on_configuration_changed, on_event and generate_event_name
      have been moved to a new namespace called script (so from now use script.on_load(...)). This will break many mods!
      The callback registered in on_load function doesn't have access to the game API. This is to avoid common desyncs.
      The on_init and on_configuration_changed still retain the access to the game API.
    - on_configuration_changed is fired when the map version changes, a mod version changes, a mod is added, or a mod is removed and passes "data":
      Pushes old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x" when loading map versions other than the current version
      When a mod version is changed it appears as a table of mod changes: {["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x"}, ...}
      When a mod is added it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version=nil, new_version="x.x.x"}
      When a mod is removed it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version=nil}
    - Changed LuaGameScript::makefile to LuaGameScript::write_file and added an optional third parameter bool to append.
  Modding:
    - Replaced entity type "rail" with types "straight-rail" and "curved-rail". Property "bending_type" is optional for rail entities,
      but is still mandatory for rail remnants.

      and returns a new rail (or nil) following that specification from the given rail entity.
    - LuaTrain::front_rail, LuaTrain::back_rail, LuaTrain::rail_direction_from_front_rail and LuaTrain::rail_direction_from_back_rail

Version: 0.12.1
Date: 24. 07. 2015
  Features:
    - Burner inserters start with enough energy to pick up 1 item and fuel them selfs.
  Changes:
    - Train station names use natural string comparing (station "Iron 10" comes after "Iron 9", not after "Iron 1").
    - New command-line parameter: --latency-ms. Allows to set server latency in milliseconds rather than ticks
    - You can copy paste circuit network conditions between Inserter, Lamp, Pump and Offshore Pump.
    - The delete button in Load Game or Save Game dialogs now asks for confirmation before deleting

    - LuaSurface can be invalid when read from LuaPlayer and Player entity if the player is disconnected from the game (MP disconnect) - use LuaSurface.valid to check.
      Note: LuaSurface currently never switches between valid and not valid so the check only has to be done when it's first read from the LuaPlayer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.12.0
Date: 17. 07. 2015
  Major Features:
    - The game is now finished by launching the rocket with satellite.
    - Added chain signals, they can be used to make more complicated junctions and stations without deadlocks.
    - Added personal roboport as modular armor equipment.
      Once it is active, it uses the materials and robots in the players inventory.
      It supports all the tasks construction robots can do like building blueprints, repairing structures, deconstruction etc.
    - Added logistic trash fields to the character gui.
      They supply items into the logistic system in the same way active provider chests do.
    - Added combinators (Arithmetic Combinator, Decider Combinator and Constant combinator).
      These allow more advanced manipulation with the circuit network logic (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-88)
    - Multiplayer latency hiding (gives impression that some common tasks are performed immediately)
      Applies to character movement, mining buildings, building, fast replacing, opening guis, etc.
    - Stone brick can be used to build stone path. (30% walking speed increase).
    - Concrete can be created.
      The concrete can be used to build concrete floors (40% walking speed increase).
    - Terrain modifies vehicle friction force (sand: 1.8, grass: 1.6, dirt: 1.4, stone path: 1.1, concrete: 0.8).
    - The Lamp, Storage Tank, Small Pump and Offshore Pump can be connected to the circuit network.
  Features:
    - Trees degenerate slowly when there high pollution levels.
    - Lab research is now continuous. Science packs have progress bars of usage.
      This means that 20 labs doing research with 10 units will still be faster than 10
      labs and the science packs aren't wasted.
    - Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it (3 X recipe demand).
      Example: The rocket silo requires 1000 steel, while the stack size is 100, but the input stack can hold enough.
    - Added / updated sounds for biters, spitters, worm, spawner, flamethrower, tank, lasers, etc.
    - New ambient soundtrack added.
      Added mechanism that prevents playing track that was played recently.
      The ambient player alternates between neutral wind/environment sounds and soundtrack songs.
    - Mousing over a train will show you its current path and blocks it can't enter.
    - Locomotives now show the contents of attached cargo wagons in their tooltip.
    - Trees regenerate health slowly.
    - Added support for transferring contents/settings when fast-replacing all entity types.
    - Added modules to the alt-view for entities that support modules.
    - Factorio can run as a dedicated server without graphics (http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiplayer#Headless_server).
    - Basic PvP: New forces can now be created and merged back together; a cease-fire can be agreed upon between forces
    - IPv6 support for multiplayer.
    - DNS names can be used when connecting to multiplayer game.
    - Enabled mining trees/ghosts while holding blueprints to be built.
    - Added explosive cannon shells.
    - Building blueprints over existing ghosts restores the ghost time to live to full.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.9.0 version (You can use 0.9.8 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - Removed rocket defense entity.
    - Items on transport belts don't go off the belt at the end, so the transport belt has
      to go directly in front of the required inserter.
    - Reduced number of rendered Roboport connections.
    - The trade in the marketplace only happens if the player can accept the trade items.
    - Inserters can now extract from Roboports and Beacons.
    - Inserters now take items from right behind them, not from the center of the pickup target entity.
    - Copy entity settings mechanism now remembers only the last entity copied from.
      Also mechanism allows copy/paste across different entities of the same type (i.e. assembling machine 1 -> assembling machine 2) and
      from assembling machines to requester chests (sets filters to 2 x requirements of the assembling machine).
    - Trees have generally smaller bounding boxes, so it is easier to walk through forest.
    - Power armor modules generate and consume 100 times more power in order to be able to charge construction robots.
    - The construction robots don't build gate in the gap between the rolling stock vehicles. They wait for the train to get away.
    - Player's logistic filters are now remembered after respawn in multiplayer
    - All turrets are now 4x4; laser turrets are 4x more expensive and powerful, gun turrets are 2x more expensive
    - Roboport tooltip now shows correct numbers of construction and logistic robots separately.
    - When a train loses a path and cannot find a new one, it stops immediately. This prevents it from riding into parts of the rail network, from where it can't find a path.
    - Improvements to circuit network wire connection. You can connect multiple wires of the same color to the same entity.

      this means that the game runs 3 times faster.
    - Optimised the transport belt movement.
    - Optimised the rotated bounding box collisions checks (trains).
    - Optimised the smoke update.

    - Optimised the land mine activation mechanism.
    - Smaller multiplayer heartbeat packet size.
    - Optimised adding/removing of roboport, robots keep their tasks if they can.
    - Path finder will terminate when search is too long. This avoids save explosions (see https://forums.factorio.com/12580).
    - Optimised rendering for large logistic networks.
    - Fixed that the graphics were saved twice in the RAM memory.
  Graphics:
    - New graphics of the combat robots.
    - New graphics of the laser/gun turrets, their color is now player/force dependent.
    - New graphics of muzzle flash for player, car, tank and turrets.

    - Fixed that the rail directions were messed up when building rails from script.
      The mechanism, that changes the rail direction based on the position is still used for manual building, to allow the user
      to build diagonal rails without having to switch direction after every piece.

    - Solved that inventory was not sorted after crafting in god mode.
    - Solved that inventory was not sorted after another stack of items was moved to cursor when building, or
      when ammo stack was moved to gun slots from inventory when the previous slot was depleted.
    - Fixed that transport belts were still animating and emitting sounds even when they were stopped and prepared
      for deconstruction.
    - Fixed that construction robots, when deconstructing splitters/belts to ground didn't remove the items on these
      the same way as on regular transport belts first. The result was random items leftovers after deconstruction.

    - Fixed crashes in multiplayer freeplay after building rocket defense.
    - Fixed train movement problems - both desync and the "Ok, so we didn't make the train movement right" errors.
    - Fixed that ghosts of turrets were not removed when turret was built over.
    - Attempted to fix the "receiveMovementImpulse ended up with unreasonable position" car and tank error.
    - Unified the Floating point model on all windows distributions. That might solve the 32bit/64bit desync issues.
    - Fixed bug with double-clicking in assembler gui during autosaving (https://forums.factorio.com/6515).
    - Fixed bug with burner inserter grabbing coal even when setup with full stack (https://forums.factorio.com/5856).

    - Walls and gates are fast replaceable.
    - In Multiplayer, research progress gui (in the top right) blinks once research has completed.
      There is no technology window popup anymore. This is optional behavior in single player as well.
    - Fixed bug that SP game wouldn't have commands allowed after loaded from MP game.
    - MapEditor doesn't allow to place and edit character anymore. Instead a spawn point (red flag) can be put on map.

    - Fixed that events giving player index were crashing in the sandbox mode.
      (on_picked_up_item, on_built_entity, on_player_mined_item, on_preplayer_mined_item, on_player_createditem, onplayerrotatedetity)
    - Fixed crashes when modifying style of gui of player that has no view (always in multiplayer).
    - LuaPlayer::name (read) now contains the player name.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.1
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed test code leftover that artificially created desync every 20 seconds.
    - Fixed the localisation errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.0
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Major Features:
    - First version of the multiplayer.
      Only co-op mode. Simplistic UI. Requires a public IP address for connecting to.
      Tested mostly on LAN. Replays of MP games don't work yet. Number of players is not limited.
    - Added gates, they open when friendly player comes by. Gates built on straight rails become rail gates.
    - Added a tank. It is way more durable than a car. It has its own set of weapons.
    - Added spitters. They are a next evolution step of biters with a ranged (spitting) attack.
      They are spawned in their own spawners (different mask color) but only after evolution reaches 0.3.
  Features:
    - The console works as a chat tool by default now.
      Ingame commands can be used, /w for whisper or /c for lua command (previous functionality). For more type /help.
    - Highlight of the items added into the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/3189)
    - Randomized lights turning on and off during dawn and dusk (https://forums.factorio.com/3493)
    - Item entities are now deconstructable.
    - Added a cancel deconstruction option to the deconstruction planner.
    - Copy/paste entity settings (filters) for cargo wagons (like e.g. recipes for assembling machines).
  Bugfixes:
    - Loads of determinism fixes, mainly for the multiplayer, but the replay stability should improve a lot as well.
    - When game speed is < 1 the gui doesn't lag.
    - Fixed crash when trying to connect trains in a situation that would result in collision of the new train with other trains
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5853).
    - Fixed invalid directions in game.create_entity() crashing the game.
    - Calling game.take_screenshot{} no longer crashes the game.
    - Fixed that some entities weren't placeable in the map editor (worm corpses).
    - Fixed incorrectly disabled New game -> Custom scenario -> Confirm button.
    - Fixed that turret could be walked over when rebuilt until the game was reloaded.
    - Accidental building is now not possible when viewing the map.
    - Compatibility fix of the new OS X Yosemite.
    - Syntax error in script locale is now shown ingame, without closing the program.
    - Fixed crash when placing blueprints with wires over existing ghosts with wires (https://forums.factorio.com/5966)
    - Fixed the rail segment bug, when mod adds two same rails at the same position.
  Graphics:
    - New player animation. Three levels depending on the armor. All with masks.
    - Rail endings.
    - Biters/Spitters/Spawners/Worms are now drawn using the same picture with differently colored masks.
      This allows making different color combinations of biters without rising the video memory requirements.(Mods!)
    - Blood splashes when units die are now procedural.
  Balancing:
    - Stone walls need research (just red science packs needed).
    - Slower crafting (0.5s->10s) of solar panels and accumulators.
    - Fast/Express splitter are made from the lower variants (same as with transport belts/underground belts)
    - Small electric pole can be used as fuel.
    - Changed wood fuel value from (0.6MJ->2MJ), so 2X wood made from raw wood has the same fuel value as the original raw wood.
  Optimisations:
    - Faster map drawing.
    - Optimized main loop. The game will automatically skip rendering when it can't keep up with expected updates per second.
      LowFPS mode has been removed because this functionality fully replaces it (it automatically lowers FPS when needed).
    - Added Bitmap Memory Caching. This allows to store certain sprites classes (defined by priority) in RAM and load them only when needed.
      If your computer has little VRAM try setting "Bitmap Caching Level" (in GraphicsSettings) to "very low".
      This will keep the trains / player and enemies dying animations in RAM, saving a lot of VRAM.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.7.0 version (You can use 0.7.5 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - New physics for cars. Car now does very little damage when colliding.
    - Disabled shooting from a vehicle (capsules can still be thrown).
  Modding:
    - Added phases to the mod loading. data.lua of all mods is loaded first, then the data-updates.lua and the data-final-fixes.lua as last.
      This allows mods to change the data of other mods without the need to be last. This is used even in the base game, to add the
      dust effect when a building is created, so the effect is added to mod buildings as well.
    - Every animation / sprite can now have a color tint.
    - Every animation / sprite can have any number of "overlays" (see how player masks work).
    - Changed the frame_width/frame_height properties of animation to width/height so it is the same as in sprite.
    - Better specification for enemy spawner units (see biter-spawner for example).
    - Furnace and assembling machine have been internally united. They the the same animation and quite a few properties
      (crafting_categories, energy_usage, crafting_speed, animation, working_visualisations).
      As a result Furnace can now have fluid boxes and use recipes with multiple outputs (but not multiple inputs).
    - Extended car prototypes to make tanks possible.
    - Electric turret uses ammo_type directly from its attack_parameters.
    - Attack parameters accept warmup field which defines the delay before the effects take place (but animation and sound start playing instantly).
      This is now used for spitter shooting animation only.
  Scripting:
    - Lua API for writing / reading player color (i.e. game.player.color = {r=0.7, g=0.4, b=0.3})
    - Fixed saving and loading references to LuaEntity and LuaItem prototypes.
    - Fixed crash when calling game.set_tiles() with invalid parameters.
    - Added New LuaFluidBox object to interact with liquids.
    - Lua API for reading backer names of entities (and writing station-names).
    - Expansion of get_circuit_condition-method; the returned table contains a new key "fulfilled" which
      indicates if condition is met.
    - Expansion of get/set/clear-filter methods to allow access to cargo wagon filters
    - Changed onplayercrafted; it is now called for every item in the crafting queue crafted
    - Added new events:
      on_robot_built_entity: passes entity built
      on_robot_pre_mined: identical to on_preplayer_mined_item but called by robots
      on_robot_mined: identical to on_player_mined_item
      on_research_started: passes the research name
      on_research_finished: passes the research finished
      on_player_rotated_entity: passes the entity rotated
      on_marked_for_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_canceled_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_trigger_created_entity: passes the entity created; only called if the trigger creating the entity has been marked with "trigger_created_entity = true"
      on_train_changed_state: passes the train
    - Added show_entity_info parameter to take_screenshot.
    - Function gettext was removed completely, localised strings are now specified by the curly-brackets {"key", {"key-parameter"}, "literal parameter", 7}
    - Added disconnect_neighbour: used with electric poles; takes the circuit connector to disconnect - none to disconnect standard copper wire.
    - Added ghost-related methods:
      ghost_name read: the ghost entity name
      ghost_localised_name read: the localised ghost entity name
      ghost_type read: the ghost entity type
      ghost_prototype read: the ghost entity prototype
      time_to_live read/write: the number of ticks until the ghost dies
    - Expanded direction and recipe to provide write access
    - Expanded methods to support reading/writing from ghost entities: (connect_neighbour, disconnect_neighbour, direction, get_circuit_condition, set_circuit_condition,
      clear_circuit_condition, orientation, rotateable, recipe, backer_name)
    - Changed set_circuit_condition parameters to: {circuit = index, operator = operator, name = name, count = count}
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing information from special items (ammo, armor, blueprints, tools)
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing armor equipment and equipment grids
    - Expanded methods for trains:
      locomotives read: returns the locomotives for the train
      state read: returns the current train state (train states are defined in defines.trainstate)
    - Lua objects can now be passed between scripts with remote.call().
      If an invalid object is passed the destination interface receives nil in place of the object.
    - Added game.players[] - returns a table of the current players
    - Expanded player-related methods to pass "player_index" of the player doing the action. If there is no player (map editor) the "player_index" value will be nil.
      (on_picked_up_item, on_built_entity, on_player_mined_item, on_preplayer_mined_item, on_player_createditem, onplayerrotatedetity)
    - Added "player_index" read to LuaGuiElement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.10.12
Date: 16.9. 2014
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to set a filter.
    - Fixed that fast replacing moved items primary to character, it made upgrading chests and machines not practical.
      Instead, when fast replacing, the content is always transferred to the new entity, when it can't fit, it transfers
      to player, and if it can't be moved to the player as well it makes the good old item bomb.
    - The right ui container is slightly larger, so it can contain the roboport info without enlarging.
    - The worm turrets are not taken into consideration when deciding enemy expansions.
    - Fixed that enemy expansion candidates were not updated correctly when base was destroyed.
    - Fixed that combat robots were on the map/minimap.
    - Fixed extra mouse buttons over gui behavior (https://forums.factorio.com/5810).
  Balancing:
    - The maximum distance for enemy expansion was increased from 5 to 7.
  Scripting:

    - The notifications of destroyed buildings are created only when someone other than player (or his machines) destroys the building.
      This affects player destroying his buildings manually and also land-mine destroying itself on impact.
    - Fixed that slightly more robots than needed could be send to empty provider chest (https://forums.factorio.com/5613).
    - When unresearching (using script) the toolbelt, the items that can't fit it are inserted back into the player's inventory.

    - Fixed that the player mined item event was not called when he got just part of the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/5608).
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to start fullscreen game in other than the primary window. There is now settings in config in category [graphics] section:
      preffered-screen-index. Changing the value changes the display adapter (monitor) that is used. If many people use this feature in the future, we can put it in the
      graphics settings ingame as well (https://forums.factorio.com/5048).

    - Fixed crash when starting game without config file.
  Gui:
    - Progress bar showing electricity availability is now colored. Green for all required energy available, yellow, more than half, red less than half.
  Modding:
    - Progress bar style enables to specify different colors for different ranges of values.
  Scripting:
    - Added game.get_chunks() iterator and game.is_chunk_generated(...) and game.player.force.is_chunk_charted() methods.
    - Pre player mined item event is called really before the player starts to get items from the inventory.
      Note that the change means, that the event is called even when the mine can eventually fail
      (not enough inventory to hold all the items). In the future, we might add an event for when the entity is really going to be removed.

    - Removed so called "item bomb" effect. It happened When the player tried to a mine chest that contained items that couldn't fit his inventory.
      Instead of dropping all the items on the ground around (which could be A LOT of items in some cases), the mining just fails, while player
      gets as many items from the chest as possible.
    - Fixed performance when cancelling large crafting queues and the player has no room to hold the items.
      This also fixes performance when a loot-enabled entity dies and drops a large amount of loot.
    - Fixed bug when sometimes rail segments were messed up by placing rail signals from blueprint (https://forums.factorio.com/5350).

      the assembling machine, rather than use it to change direction of existing machines (https://forums.factorio.com/5239).
    - Allowed to check placeability of item on ground from script as long as the item is specified (https://forums.factorio.com/5238).

    - Roboport gui says "repair packs" not "material" (https://forums.factorio.com/5351).
  Balancing:
    - Roboport is no longer categorised as military structure.

      While building blueprints, player can rotate these, and they can also overlap with existing entities as long as they match.
    - Deconstruction tool. Allows player to order construction robots to deconstruct buildings in the selected area.
      When the buildings contain items (chests, transport belts etc.) construction robots first move these items out of it and place it
      into the logistics network.
    - Oil industry.
      Pumpjacks mine the crude oil from the oil spills.
      Oil refinery processes the crude oil to oil fractions.
      Chemical plant processes the oil fractions to useful products.
    - Added fluid storage tank.

    - Recipe gui contains even recipes not craftable by player (their tooltip shows machines where they can be crafted).
    - Copying entity settings (replaces the old shift build functionality).
      Shift + left click sets the selected entity as a copy source, shift + right click applies the settings to selected entity.
    - Ghost buildings can be built (shift + right click) and mined individually.
    - Saves directory can contain custom sub directories. Added delete save button.
    - Game saves and mods are read / written natively to the zip files.

    - Optimisation of inserters update, inserters that have nothing to do are set to sleep and woke up when their target/source changes.
    - Turrets don't search for enemies when there are no enemies nearby.
    - Logistic network doesn't go through empty provider chests/satisfied requester chests any more, so they don't slow down the update.
    - Only chunks with changes are re-charted, so the limit of 2 re-charted chunks per ticks is applied only on chunk that actually changed,
      this allows to have much higher areas covered by radars.
    - Optimisation of the building electric poles by dragging (It could get slow for big networks).
    - Small optimisation of transport belt movement.
  Balancing:
    - Changed many existing recipes (science pack 2, science pack 3, advanced circuit, laser turret, car, diesel locomotive,
        logistic and construction robots, rocket, flamethrower ammo, defender capsules, most of the armor equipment, etc.)

    - MiningDrill can be built only if there are some resources within its radius.
    - The world is slowly generated around the player up to big distance, so exploring should not matter regarding
      the existence of enemies.

    - Locomotive + wagon + rails are more expensive.
    - More random looking enemy base generation.
    - Machines using electricity can have limited maximum input/output flow per second,
      so accumulators don't recharge/give energy instantly and laser turrets take energy,
      more continuously.
    - Ambient (music) isn't loaded all at start, but instead streaming realtime while playing, this
      reduces game starting time and memory requirements.
    - Removed the limit to pickup 1 item per tick when player is picking items.
    - Player picks all items in range when picking items on ground (not just 1 per tick as it was until now)

      research and enabled state of technologies, so it is usable in migrations to reload existing technologies that changed.
    - Enabled to have recipe with no prerequisites (just energy). In the crafting gui, it shows Infinite count craftable
      of that item (and all items dependent on recipes that are for free).

    - Fixed laser turret not consuming energy in idle state.
    - Splitter has maximum memory of 5 items when forced to send items on one side because the other one is blocked.
      This means that when left is block for a long time, and then both are free, the right will get mostly 5 items
      before it is split 1:1 again.
    - Fixed that the electric pole has the same orientation all the time (regardless connections)
  Gui:
    - Removed the text length limit from the input console.
    - Wrapping of the console text in the game.
  Modding:
    - Mods are self sustainable folders now. They contain the prototype definitions, graphics, sounds, locale, scenarios or campaigns.
    - Mods Gui in the game to enable / disable mods and change their ordering.
    - The default game contents is treated as a mod (called base).
    - Prototype definitions are generated by Lua scripts (no json anymore). Mods can manipulate the definitions from previous mods.
    - Mods can have control.lua script that supplements / changes the behavior of the default scenario script.
    - Multiple running scripts (from the mods) can communicate with each other using interfaces.
    - General furnace energy source specification in json (so it can be electric)
    - Started to use the name of the recipe, this allows different recipes for the same product.
      Having different recipes for the same product for player crafting is not tested (regarding the auto crafting)
    - Translation files are merged properly.
    - Default English fallback for translations.
  Scripting:
    - Simple way to add gui elements using script.
    - Divided the player and its character, some functions that are not directly connected with the character (goal description, printing etc)
      are accessible from the player object, the rest from the character.
      The access to character is game.player.character
    - The migration script runs before the control.lua is loaded and can be used to reload scripts from the original scenario
      this is used to solve the issue of incompatible scripts in the save game.
    - Merged onunitdied and onplayerdied to on_entity_died
    - Check for positive addition in the LuaInventory::insert method
    - Added LuaInventory::remove method
    - Added LuaInventory::get_contents method
    - Simpler access to player from game object (game.player instead of game.get_player())
    - Added LuaRecipe::reload method
    - Added force parameter in create_entity so player can specify the owner of the created entity (was always enemy now)
    - Added way to change force of entity and damage entity (damaging is different then sethealth).
    - Position doesn't need to be in format {x = 34, y = 7}, the format {34 ,7} works as well, the
      same with bounding box.
    - Added simple interface for the Freeplay that allows manipulating the attacks from mod scripts.
    - Scripts receive only events they have subscribed to.
    - Scripts can emit their own events (for instance Freeplay emits an event whenever it starts the attack).

      b) It is possible to run console commands in these games.
    - Tool tip in technology preview shows total raw in the same system as in player crafting gui
      (Using just recipes that player can use for the calculations, so not smelting)

      that had unicode characters in their user name on windows and wanted to load save Users/<Name>/AppData/..

    - Fixed freezing with some certain combinations of directions of locomotives in train.
