You may experience performance issues, missing graphics, crashes, or the game may not be able to start at all. The recommended video memory size for high quality sprites is at least 3 GB.

[gui-graphics-settings-description]
max-threads=The number of threads used to render the game.
graphics-quality-label=The resolution of the sprites. Determines VRAM usage. Warning: 'High' resolution requires at least 3 GB of VRAM.
lights-quality=The rendering resolution of lights during the night. High values will greatly reduce performance.
show-smoke=Disable to increase performance on low-end video cards.
video-memory-usage-label=Determines how many sprites the game will try to put into sprite atlases. Creating larger sprite atlases reduces CPU usage due to the ability to batch draw calls, but may increase GPU load, because the GPU has to work with larger textures. Free floating sprites can be loaded into VRAM or kept in RAM (see Low VRAM mode setting).
texture-streaming=Sprites that were not put into any sprite atlas (see Video memory usage setting) will be kept in RAM until needed by the GPU.
atlas-specialization=Instead of creating a single large sprite atlas, the game will sort sprites into smaller atlases based on their expected usage. Increases CPU usage due to higher draw call count, but it usually easier for the graphics driver to handle smaller textures.
texture-compression=Enables compression on sprites with low detail (shadows and color masks). Reduces VRAM usage. May also reduce GPU load at the price of higher CPU usage due to less efficient sprite batching. Causes longer startup time.
separate-lower-object-atlas=Sprites drawn under shadows will be put in a separate sprite atlas with enabled mipmaps. Can reduce GPU load, at the price of increased VRAM and CPU usage.
tree-sprite-mipmaps=Tree sprites will be put in a separate sprite atlas with enabled mipmaps. Can reduce GPU load, at the price of increased CPU usage. It may cause performance issues on high game resolutions.
trilinear-filtering=Makes icons look smoother in the GUI. There is no reason to turn this off unless there is some issue or icons are blurred out.
sprite-atlas-size-label=Larger atlases improve draw call batching which reduces CPU load in rendering, but may be harder to handle for GPU.
atlas-packing-optimization=Large sprites with a lot of transparent areas (mainly train rotations) will be sliced to smaller images. This makes better use of atlas textures (reducing VRAM usage), but increases CPU load as more images need to be rendered.
low-quality-sprite-rotation=Trains will load only half of the normal count of rotation variants. This greatly reduces VRAM usage.
